# XYZ Trajectory Distance Calculator

This Python script reads a molecular dynamics trajectory in XYZ format and calculates the Euclidean distance between two specified atoms for every simulation step.

Features
- Parses multi-frame .xyz trajectory files
- Computes the distance between two atom indices 
- Handles large trajectories without external dependencies
- Reports the number of frames processed and total runtime
